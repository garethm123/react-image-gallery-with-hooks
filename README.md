# What is this React Image Gallery Component?

Just a simple gallery that stores images as an array in state.

When a small image is clicked, it will display larger as an overlay with a small css animation-in.

Test it out - <a href="https://responsive-react-gallery.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Demo</a>

## Requirements/dependancies

Just React and React-DOM.. no other dependancies required for this to work. It also works with Next.js (I'm using it on one of my own projects)

## Download and run

To get this working, download and run 'npm install' then 'cd react-image-gallery' then 'npm start'

## What's included

This is a working example built with CRA, however you can simply take the two components and the css and copy it into your project to make any adjustments to styling/images array.

### Two simple components:

- Gallery.js (the main component you need to import as \<\Gallery /> wherever you want the gallery)
- Popup.js (the component which displays the larger images)

### CSS 

And a small CSS file for the styling.
